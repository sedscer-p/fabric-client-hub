## Developement Practices
- Utilize .env for sensitive information.
- Use the config file to hold necessary constants and variables.
- Only write additional .md files when you are asked to.
- NO FEATURE CREEP JUST ADD THE FEATURES YOU ARE ASKED TO ADD, ALWAYS ASK IF YOU ARE UNSURE
- Ensure to leave succinct, clear comments where required to understand the function of code.
- Write straightforward, readable code. Avoid unnecessary complexity, clever tricks, or overengineering. Choose the simplest solution that solves the problem.
- Only implement features and functions that are currently required. Don't add code for hypothetical use cases or future needs or "just in case" scenarios.
- Eliminate code duplication. Extract related logic into reusable functions, classes, or modules. Each piece of knowledge should have a single authoritative representation.
- Only use generally accepted best practices from large technology companies like Google.
