A: Good to see you, James. Feels like no time at all.
J: I know. Although it also feels like about five years have happened in between.
A: That’s usually a sign it’s been a busy year. How are you?
J: Generally better than last year. Still tired, but less… on edge, I’d say.
A: That’s good to hear. How was the journey in?
J: Standard Wimbledon gridlock. At least AFC Wimbledon aren’t at home today or it’d be even worse.
A: Still going regularly?
J: Absolutely. Season ticket renewed. That’s non-negotiable. Emma jokes that if we ever needed to cut costs, that’d be the last thing to go.
A: You described it last year as grounding.
J: It still is. It’s my mental reset button. Ninety minutes where I’m not thinking about work or pensions or interest rates.
A: That’s important. Speaking of work, how’s the year been professionally?
J: Rocky. We had that restructure in March — I think I mentioned it in the email.
A: Yes.
J: Two senior people went. I stayed, but it was a proper wake-up call.
A: How did that land with you emotionally?
J: It made everything we talked about last year feel very real, very quickly. That fear of “what if this all disappears” — it wasn’t theoretical anymore.
A: Income-wise, how did things shake out?
J: Base stayed at £130k. Bonus was down — about £22k. So still fine, but noticeably less.
A: And Emma?
J: Pretty similar to last year. Around £32k. Freelance is always a bit lumpy.
A: Has that variability felt more stressful with higher mortgage payments?
J: Definitely. When the mortgage jumped, we suddenly felt much more sensitive to cash flow.
A: Let’s talk about that. You came off the 1.9% fix, right?
J: Yeah. We fixed again at 5.1% for five years.
A: And the balance at renewal?
J: About £405k. So it’s come down a bit from last year.
A: Monthly impact?
J: Roughly £780 more a month.
A: How are you managing that?
J: We planned for it mentally, but it still stung. Fewer holidays, more discipline. But we’re coping.
A: What’s the house worth now, roughly?
J: Estate agents would probably say around £1.15m, maybe £1.2m on a good day.
A: So still strong equity.
J: Yeah. That’s reassuring, even though we don’t plan to move.
A: Last year, one of the big themes was cash buffers. You said savings felt like “everything and nothing”. What’s the position now?
J: Much clearer. We’ve got £30k ring-fenced as a true emergency fund — separate account, not touched.
A: And outside that?
J: Another £18k in a general savings pot. That’s for holidays, car stuff, school trips, that sort of thing.
A: That’s after the kitchen spend?
J: Yes. The kitchen cost about £28k, all from savings, but we deliberately didn’t touch the emergency fund.
A: How does that feel now?
J: Much calmer. Knowing that six months of bills are covered if something goes wrong… it really helps.
A: That was a big anxiety point last year.
J: Yeah. Probably the biggest.
A: Let’s talk investments. You consolidated your pensions into a SIPP — how did that process feel?
J: Scary at first. Seeing everything in one place was confronting. But also motivating.
A: Did you change the investment approach?
J: Yes, that was important to me. Last year I said the default funds felt too passive and a bit “set and forget”.
A: And now?
J: We agreed on a medium-to-growth risk profile. About 75% growth assets, globally diversified. More equity exposure than before, but still sensible.
A: How comfortable are you with that risk level?
J: More comfortable than I expected. Because I understand it now. Before, I was nervous because I didn’t know what I was invested in.
A: And performance?
J: Pretty decent. SIPP’s around £495k now, up from roughly £460k when we consolidated.
A: How did you feel during market volatility?
J: Less reactive. I didn’t panic. Didn’t log in every day like I used to.
A: That’s a big behavioural win.
J: Yeah. Crypto taught me what not to do.
A: You sold that, right?
J: I did. Took the loss. Sold at about £9k.
A: Any lingering feelings about it?
J: Relief, mostly. It stopped taking up mental space.
A: What about ISAs? You had about £90k combined last year.
J: Yes. They’re at about £102k now.
A: So growth plus contributions?
J: Both. We added about £8k over the year between us. Performance did the rest.
A: Same investment strategy as the pension?
J: Broadly, yes. Similar funds, similar risk profile. It feels more joined-up now.
A: That was something you wanted — cohesion.
J: Exactly. Before it all felt fragmented.
A: Tax-wise, did you make any changes this year?
J: Yes. We increased my pension contributions through salary sacrifice after talking about higher-rate tax last year.
A: What’s your total contribution now?
J: About £32k including employer.
A: And that felt manageable?
J: Just about. With the mortgage increase it was tight, but the tax saving made it feel worthwhile.
A: And Emma’s pension — let’s talk about that in more detail.
J: Right. So she had about £42k in an old workplace pension.
A: And the £400 a month — where’s that going?
J: Into a new personal pension in her name. We decided not to merge yet, just to keep it simple.
A: Combined value now?
J: Around £48k total.
A: How does she feel about that progress?
J: Better. Less like she’s falling behind. Still wishes she’d done more earlier, but that’s hindsight.
A: I just want to do a quick check-in on something we talked about last year, if that’s alright.
J: Sure.
A: Gambling. You’d said it had been a bit of a stress response at times, and that you’d put limits in place. How’s that been this year?
J: Yeah — still under control. I stick to the limits. If anything, I’m more aware now of why I’m tempted to bet.
A: And when those moments come up?
J: I usually clock that I’m stressed or annoyed about work. Sometimes I still place a bet, but it’s small and deliberate. It doesn’t feel compulsive anymore.
A: That’s good to hear. And you’re comfortable with where it sits now?
J: Yes. If I felt it creeping back, I’d want to address it properly. But right now, it feels contained.
A: That’s exactly what I wanted to check. Thank you for being open about it.
J: No problem. I appreciate you asking without making it awkward.
A: That’s the intention.
A: Protection-wise, last year one of your biggest worries was that everything disappeared if you left your job. Where are we now?
J: That gap is closed. That was huge for me.
A: Tell me how.
J: We set up personal life insurance — £750k level term — plus income protection outside work. So even if I left tomorrow, we’re covered.
A: And critical illness?
J: Yes — we did add that. £250k cover.
A: How did you feel about that decision?
J: Honestly? That was the hardest one emotionally. Thinking about surviving something serious rather than dying… that hit differently.
A: But you felt it was necessary?
J: Yes. Especially after the health scare last year.
A: How’s your health been since?
J: Better. Regular exercise. Fewer stress symptoms. Still need to watch my blood pressure, but I’m on top of it.
A: That’s good to hear. Any other big changes this year?
J: We decided against private secondary school.
A: And how do you feel about that now?
J: Relieved. Financially and emotionally. It would’ve put too much pressure on everything else.
A: Kids’ savings still running?
J: Yes. Junior ISAs are about £15k each now. We didn’t increase contributions this year because of the mortgage.
A: Comfortable with that decision?
J: Yes. Stability first.
A: Any new worries creeping in?
J: My mum’s health. Makes me think about future care costs. And my own ageing, if I’m honest.
A: That’s a natural next phase.
J: But overall, I feel more in control than last year.
A: That’s really noticeable, actually.
J: Is it?
A: Yes. You’re calmer. More intentional.
J: I think having a plan — and knowing the big risks are covered — has made a huge difference.
A: That’s exactly what this process is meant to do.
J: I still don’t have everything figured out. But I’m not avoiding it anymore.
A: That’s real progress.
J: Yeah. And I still get my Saturdays at Plough Lane.
A: Which is equally important.
J: Absolutely.
A: Shall we keep things as they are for the next year?
J: Yes. I’m happy with that.
A: Great. We’ll keep reviewing, adjusting, and hopefully making things even more boring — in a good way.
J: Boring finances sound perfect.
