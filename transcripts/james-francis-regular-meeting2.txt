A: Did you act on it?
J: No. I did check it more than I should have for a couple of weeks. But I didn’t change anything.
A: That’s still progress. Did it feel uncomfortable?
J: Yes. Like—I can tolerate volatility in theory, but seeing £20k swing around is… not nothing.
A: Completely. How did it affect your risk tolerance? Any desire to de-risk?
J: Temporarily, yes. I had a few days of “maybe I should be more cautious”. But then I remembered the whole point is long-term, early 60s retirement, and I’m 46. I have time.
A: That’s exactly the right framing. Let’s talk about the underlying funds. Are you clear what you’re invested in now?
J: More than before, yes. You’ve got me in that globally diversified setup—so global equity index, a UK equity slice, some emerging markets, and then bonds for ballast.
A: Yes. Do you remember roughly the split?
J: About 75% equity, 25% defensive—bonds and cash-like stuff.
A: That’s right. And performance-wise, what did well this year?
J: US-heavy global equity did well. The tech tilt helped. The UK bit… meh.
A: UK underperformed relative to the global allocation?
J: Yes. Not terrible, just… underwhelming. Emerging markets also felt sluggish for ages and then picked up a bit.
A: And the defensive side?
J: Bonds were steadier this year than the year before, but still not exciting.
A: That’s okay. Their job isn’t excitement. Did any part worry you?
J: Not worry, but it made me question whether I’m overcomplicating it. Like, do I need all these slices?
A: That’s a good question. The slicing is there for diversification, but we can simplify if it helps you stay the course. The worst portfolio is the one you abandon in a panic.
J: Exactly. I think I’m okay with it. I just want to make sure I’m not paying complexity tax.
A: Understood. We can review whether any holdings overlap and consolidate into fewer broad funds if it keeps behaviour steady.
J: That would appeal, actually.
A: What about the ISAs—last year they were £102k. Where are they now?
J: £111k combined.
A: Any contributions?
J: We contributed less than last year. Maybe £5k total.
A: Is that because of the mortgage and holiday?
J: Yeah. And the car. We didn’t stop, just reduced.
A: How do you feel about that?
J: Fine. I’d rather be realistic and consistent than stretch and then abandon it.
A: Agreed. And performance—similar story to the SIPP?
J: Yes, because they’re aligned. So when the SIPP dipped, the ISA dipped, and I had a moment of “ah, right, these are linked”.
A: That’s the joined-up strategy working—though it can feel unpleasant when everything moves together. But long-term, alignment supports your plan.
J: Makes sense.
A: Shall we do a quick recap of total position, just so you can see it end-to-end?
J: Yes, please. It helps me.
A: Okay—roughly: house £1.18m, mortgage £395k, so net property equity about £785k. Cash: £30k emergency plus £12k life pot, about £42k. ISAs about £111k. SIPP about £528k. Emma’s pension—what’s that at now?
J: Right—so her old workplace pot is around £45k now.
A: That grew since last year.
J: Yeah. And the personal pension we set up—she’s been doing £400 a month consistently—now around £11k.
A: So combined around £56k.
J: Yes.
A: Great. Junior ISAs for the kids?
J: Sophie’s is about £17k now. Tom’s about £16k. We’ve kept contributions going but modest.
A: Okay. So total investments and pensions: your SIPP £528k + ISAs £111k + Emma pensions £56k + kids JISAs £33k-ish = about £728k. Plus cash £42k. Plus property equity £785k. That’s total net worth roughly £1.55m.
J: That number always shocks me.
A: It’s because it’s spread across pots and you don’t feel it in monthly life. But it matters for retirement trajectory.
J: Yeah. It’s reassuring.
A: Speaking of retirement—last time we said early 60s, comfortable lifestyle, help kids with uni/deposits. Still the goal?
J: Yes. Early 60s feels realistic. I’d love 60, but I’m not clinging to it. 62, 63 feels fine.
A: Do you want to do a quick check-in on the modelling assumptions? Not a deep dive, but “still on track?”
J: Yes, please.
A: Broadly, with current contributions—your pension contributions via salary sacrifice at about £32k total including employer—and Emma contributing £400 a month, and assuming moderate long-term growth, you remain on track for early 60s. The main variables are: how long you keep that savings rate, what the mortgage does, and whether you face a job disruption.
J: That last one is the big one in my head.
A: Right. And that’s why protection and buffers matter. Which brings us to tax and contributions—still doing salary sacrifice?
J: Yes. I kept it. I did briefly consider dropping it after the mortgage went up, but then I saw the tax saving and thought… it’s too valuable.
A: Especially as a higher-rate taxpayer.
J: Exactly. It’s like—if I’m going to be squeezed, at least squeeze in a way that benefits me later.
A: Well put. Have you considered increasing it further or are you at your comfort limit?
J: I think comfort limit. With Sophie’s school costs and general life, I don’t want to over-tighten.
A: That’s sensible. And ISAs—we’ve not maxed the allowances, but we’re contributing something. Do you want to set a target for next year, or keep it flexible?
J: Maybe set a minimum. Like, if we can do £500 a month combined, regardless of bonuses, that feels doable.
A: Great. We can structure it so it’s automatic and you can top up if bonus is better.
J: Yes.
A: Any changes to risk tolerance after experiencing those dips this year?
J: I’d say… more tolerant overall, but still don’t like surprises. I don’t want anything exotic. No “clever” funds.
A: So still aligned with broad, low-cost, globally diversified.
J: Exactly.
A: Any temptation to go back to crypto or speculation?
J: No. Honestly, I’m cured. Seeing that loss crystallised was enough.
A: Good. What about gambling—quick check-in like last year?
J: Still under control.
A: Any wobbles?
J: A couple of weekends when work was stressful I noticed the urge. But I stuck to the limit. I’ve actually started using the app limits properly—deposit limits, time limits.
A: That’s excellent. And you feel it’s not escalating?
J: No. It’s more like I’m aware it’s a temptation, rather than pretending it doesn’t exist.
A: That’s the healthiest approach. Okay—protection. You put personal life insurance, income protection, and critical illness in place. Any changes there?
J: No major changes. Premiums went up slightly at renewal.
A: Still comfortable paying them?
J: Yes. It’s one of those things I grumble about and then remind myself why it exists.
A: And work benefits—death in service still four times salary?
J: Yes, still there. But I care less about it now because we’ve closed the gap personally.
A: Exactly. That “if I leave, it disappears” fear is addressed because the core protection is independent now.
J: That’s been huge psychologically.
A: Wills and LPAs—still in place, nothing to update?
J: No changes. Unless Sophie starts asking to be emancipated.
A: Let’s hope not.
J: She’s testing the waters.
A: Now, you mentioned your mum’s health last year. Tell me more about where that’s at now. Has anything progressed?
J: Yes. That’s probably the big emotional thing this year. She’s had a couple of falls. Nothing broken, but it’s scary.
A: Is she living alone?
J: Yes. Dad passed a few years ago, so it’s just her in the house. And she’s stubborn. Won’t accept help easily.
A: What kind of support does she have day-to-day?
J: Me and my sister. My sister lives in Surrey, I’m closer. We pop in, do shopping, check things. But it’s not formal care.
A: Have you discussed power of attorney for her?
J: We’ve tried. She hates the idea. Thinks it’s us “taking over”.
A: That’s a very common reaction.
J: Exactly. But her memory is… patchy sometimes. She repeats herself. Misplaces things. She once left the hob on.
A: That must have been frightening.
J: Yeah. It made me think, “Okay, we need a plan before this becomes a crisis.”
A: What’s your biggest worry: her safety, the financial cost, or the emotional load?
J: All three. Safety first. Then the emotional load—because it’s draining. And then, yes, cost. If she needs care, I don’t really know how it works. Who pays. How quickly it escalates.
A: Does she have assets—her home, savings?
J: She owns her house outright. Not in London—Kent. Maybe worth £450k? She has some savings, but I don’t know exactly. She’s private.
A: Okay. So there is an asset base, but it’s illiquid unless downsized or used for care.
J: Exactly. And that’s the uncomfortable conversation.
A: Would it be helpful if next year’s priority includes doing some light care planning—understanding options, likely costs, and how to approach the conversation?
J: Yes. I’d like that. Just even having a framework would calm me down.
A: We can do that. Not to make decisions for her, but to reduce uncertainty and prepare.
J: Good.
A: Any other family health issues? You mentioned blood pressure last year.
J: Mine is okay. Still borderline sometimes. But I’ve kept exercise going—mostly running and some weights. AFC Wimbledon helps too—standing up, shouting, very cardio.
A: That counts. Any mental health support? Therapy, coaching?
J: I did a few sessions with a therapist after the restructure. Not long-term, but it helped. Just to get the spiralling under control.
A: That’s a positive step.
J: Yeah. I’d rather do that than pretend I’m fine and then end up with chest pains again.
A: Exactly. Okay—next year priorities. If you had to choose three, what would they be?
J: One: keep building the boring stuff—pensions, ISAs, buffers. Two: mum—get ahead of it. Three: keep my career options open without panicking.
A: That’s a strong list. Anything about the kids? University planning, deposits?
J: Not immediately. It’s on the horizon, but Sophie is 12 now. It’s coming, but not tomorrow.
A: Junior ISAs continue as planned.
J: Yes.
A: Any appetite to increase contributions if bonus is better this year?
J: Possibly. But I’d rather do it in a planned way. Like, if bonus is £30k, maybe we allocate a chunk—ISA top-up, a bit extra in pension, a bit for holiday.
A: We can set a “bonus strategy” so it doesn’t just evaporate.
J: Yes. That would help because bonuses are where we tend to get sloppy.
A: Understood. Fees—shall we confirm ongoing costs? Last year we didn’t put a number in the transcript, but we should for realism and transparency.
J: Yes, please.
A: Your ongoing advice fee is 0.75% per annum on assets under advice. Based on the SIPP and ISA values we’re advising on—roughly £639k combined (£528k SIPP + £111k ISA)—that’s approximately £4,792 per year, charged monthly, so about £399 a month.
J: Right. That aligns with what I’ve seen coming out.
A: And that includes annual review meetings like this, ongoing portfolio oversight, rebalancing guidance, tax planning conversations, and ad hoc queries.
J: Yes. I’ve used the ad hoc queries more than I expected, actually.
A: Good. That’s what it’s there for. Any concerns about the fee at this stage?
J: No. If anything, the peace of mind has been worth it. Especially when work wobbles happen.
A: Okay. Finally—anything you’re worried I haven’t asked?
J: Just… I don’t want to over-optimise and forget to live.
A: That’s an important point.
J: Like Tuscany was expensive, but it was good for us. And the kids are only this age once.
A: Absolutely. A good plan should make space for living, not just saving.
J: Exactly.
A: Alright. So, we keep the core plan, tweak a couple of things—simplify the fund structure if it helps behaviour, set a baseline ISA contribution, define a bonus strategy, and add a care-planning workstream around your mum.
J: That sounds right.
A: And keep AFC Wimbledon as a non-negotiable wellbeing line item.
J: Exactly. Put it under “mental health expenditure”.
A: Done. Same time next year?
J: Yes. Hopefully with less drama, but knowing life, there’ll be something.
A: Life always provides content.
J: True.
A: Great. I’ll follow up with the actions we discussed.
J: Thanks. This feels… steady. In a good way.
A: That’s the goal.
