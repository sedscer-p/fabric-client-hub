DC: How do you feel about each scenario?
RF: If I'm honest? I want a clean break. Take the money and go. But I also feel responsible for the staff. Many of them have been there as long as I have. I'd want to make sure they're looked after.
MF: She's already worrying about this at three in the morning.
RF: It's true. The factory in Redditch... there's sixty people there. If the new owner decides to offshore production to China, those jobs are gone. And it'll be my fault for selling.
DC: That's a heavy responsibility to carry. But ultimately, you can only control what you can control. You can try to find a buyer who values the UK manufacturing. You can negotiate protections into the sale contract. But you can't guarantee what happens after you're gone.
RF: I know. It doesn't stop me feeling guilty in advance.
DC: Let's talk about life post-exit. Last year you said you wanted to step back at sixty. That's now eleven or twelve years away. But if the sale happens at forty-eight or forty-nine...
RF: I've been thinking about that. [Pause] I don't think I want to stop working entirely. I'd go mad. But I don't want to run another business either. Maybe some non-executive director roles? Consulting? Something that keeps my brain active without the relentless pressure.
DC: That's very common among successful business owners. They often find they miss the stimulation of work, just not the stress. Would you expect to earn meaningful income from that, or is it more about keeping busy?
RF: A bit of both? I'd want to be paid properly, but it wouldn't be about the money at that stage. Maybe fifty or a hundred thousand a year?
DC: That's helpful for modelling purposes. And the retirement lifestyle we discussed – a hundred to a hundred and twenty thousand a year – does that still feel right?
RF: Maybe a bit more now. If we've got the resources, why not enjoy them? Let's say a hundred and twenty to a hundred and fifty.
DC: And earlier than sixty?
RF: Possibly. If the business sale goes well and I transition to NED-type work, I could see fully retiring at fifty-five. Maybe even earlier. It depends how I feel.
DC: Let's model both scenarios – stepping back post-sale with some portfolio income, then fully retiring at fifty-five. We'll see what the numbers look like.
RF: Okay.
DC: Now, there's one thing we need to discuss that's a bit awkward, but important. What if the sale doesn't happen?
RF: What do you mean?
DC: Deals fall through. Economic conditions change. Buyers pull out. The PE firm might not get the price they want and decide to hold. What would that mean for you?
RF: [Long pause] I suppose I'd just... keep going. Keep running the business. But honestly, David, I don't know how much longer I can sustain this pace. If the sale falls through, I think I'd need to have a serious conversation with the board about stepping back anyway. Finding a new MD, transitioning to a chairman role or something.
DC: The point is, your financial security doesn't depend on the sale. With what you've already accumulated – pensions, ISAs, cash, the London flat, your home equity – plus Marcus's income and pension, you could retire comfortably even without the business sale. It would be a different kind of retirement – maybe ninety thousand a year instead of a hundred and fifty – but you wouldn't be struggling.
MF: I keep telling her this. We're not relying on that money. It would be wonderful, but we're okay either way.
RF: I know. I think I just... I've put so much into that business. I want it to mean something.
DC: It already means something. You've built something valuable, employed hundreds of people over the years, made a success of an industry that was supposed to be dead. The money is almost secondary to that.
RF: [Pause] Thank you. That's kind.
DC: Right. Let's talk about inheritance tax, because with numbers like these, it becomes very relevant.
RF: I was afraid you'd say that.
DC: Currently, your combined estate – properties, investments, cash, everything – is probably worth around two and a half to three million, excluding the business. The business might qualify for Business Relief and pass free of IHT, but we'd need to confirm that. With nil-rate bands and residence nil-rate bands, you and Marcus together have about a million in exemptions. So there's a potential IHT liability of maybe five hundred thousand to a million on your current position.
RF: That's... a lot.
DC: Post business sale, if you're suddenly sitting on an additional eight to ten million in cash and investments, the liability grows enormously. At forty percent, you could be looking at four or five million in inheritance tax.
MF: Four or five million going to the government instead of to Olivia and Ethan?
DC: Unless we plan for it, yes. There are strategies – trusts, gifts out of surplus income, business property relief on new investments, pension accumulation, whole-of-life insurance to cover the liability – but they all require advance planning.
RF: What would you recommend?
DC: We'll need to do proper analysis, but initial thoughts: maximise pension contributions because pensions are outside your estate for IHT purposes. Consider gifts to the children – outright gifts, or into trusts – once you have certainty on the sale. Potentially invest in assets that qualify for Business Relief, which could provide some protection. And look at insurance to cover any remaining liability.
RF: That's a lot to take in.
DC: It is. And we don't need to decide everything today. But we should start thinking about it now, so that when the sale happens, we're ready.
RF: Okay.

# COMMENTED OUT FOR TESTING - Fee discussion section (lines 39-46)
# DC: Let's talk briefly about fees. You're currently on our ongoing service at nought point eight five percent of assets under management, plus an annual planning fee for the broader work. Is that still working for you?
# RF: Yes, I think so. The fee feels fair for what we're getting.
# DC: The assets under our management are currently around four hundred thousand – your ISAs and GIA primarily. As your investable assets grow, particularly post-sale, we might want to discuss whether a tiered fee structure makes more sense. Paying nought point eight five percent on ten million would be eighty-five thousand a year, which is a lot.
# RF: Yes, that does seem excessive.
# DC: We typically tier our fees for larger portfolios. Maybe nought point eight five percent on the first million, then nought point six percent up to five million, then nought point four percent above that. It would depend on the services you need.
# RF: That sounds more reasonable. Can we revisit that when the time comes?
# DC: Absolutely. No changes for now – this is just advance planning.

DC: Alright. Before we wrap up, let me just check in on a few other things. Health – how are you both? Any changes?
RF: I'm fine. Blood pressure is still controlled with medication. Had my annual check-up, all fine.
MF: I'm good. Touch wood. Fifty years old and still functioning.
DC: No new diagnoses, medications, anything that might affect your protection policies?
RF: No, nothing.
DC: Good. And just to confirm – no other significant changes we haven't covered? No new debts, no family issues, nothing lurking that I should know about?
RF: [Pause] Actually, there is one thing. I didn't mention it because I wasn't sure it was relevant, but... Olivia's boyfriend's family have been going through some financial difficulties. His father lost his job. They've asked if Olivia can... not formally move in with them, but spend more time there, help out with the younger kids. It's a bit odd, frankly. I'm not sure what to make of it.
DC: Has that affected Olivia's studies?
RF: Not yet. But I'm keeping an eye on it. She's got her A-levels to focus on.
DC: It doesn't directly affect your financial planning, but it's good to know the context. Teenagers and their relationships can be consuming. She might need extra support.
RF: Yes. That's what I'm thinking.
DC: Anything else?
RF: No, I think that's everything.
DC: Okay. Let me summarise what we've discussed and the actions we've agreed. First, we'll update the cashflow modelling to reflect the business sale scenarios – both successful sale and sale falling through. Second, we'll continue maximising pension contributions this year and next. Third, you're going to make a decision on the London flat – sell or commit to using it. Fourth, Marcus will dig out the probate paperwork for the inherited shares so we can establish the base cost. Fifth, we'll prepare an inheritance tax planning strategy ready for post-sale implementation. Sixth, Rebecca will think about the horse situation and let me know what she decides. And seventh, we'll keep monitoring the protection policies and review cover levels post-sale.
RF: That all makes sense.
DC: And Rebecca – look after yourself. The next twelve to eighteen months are going to be intense. Don't burn out before you get to enjoy the outcome.
RF: I'm trying. Marcus keeps me grounded.
MF: That's what husbands are for.
DC: I'll have the updated analysis and recommendations to you within three weeks. Shall we schedule a follow-up call before Christmas to go through them?
RF: Yes, let's do that. Maybe mid-December?
DC: I'll have Emma send some dates. And don't hesitate to call if anything comes up before then – any news on the sale process, any questions, anything at all.
RF: Thank you, David. As always, I feel better for having talked through everything.
MF: Yes, thanks. I understand now why Rebecca always comes back from these meetings looking less stressed.
DC: That's what we're here for. Safe travels back to Solihull.
RF: Thanks. See you in December.
MF: Cheers, David.
