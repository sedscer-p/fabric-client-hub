DC: But you have personal income protection now.
RF: Yes. That would kick in after six months if I couldn't work. But being pushed out isn't the same as being unable to work. Would it even apply?
DC: Income protection typically covers illness or disability, not redundancy. So you're right – if you left the business for non-health reasons, that policy wouldn't help. But you'd have your personal assets, plus Marcus's income, plus potential claims against the PE firm if they breached your rights.
MF: And I'd still be working. Sixty-five thousand wouldn't cover our current lifestyle, but we wouldn't starve.
DC: Let's think about your essential expenses. Mortgage payments on two hundred and eighty thousand at, say, four and a half percent – that's roughly seventeen hundred a month. School fees for Ethan – about two thousand a month for another year and a half. Olivia's university costs – fifteen hundred a month. Council tax, utilities, food, cars, insurance – maybe another three thousand. So essential outgoings of around eight to nine thousand a month.
RF: Which is more than Marcus earns after tax.
DC: Yes. But you've got two hundred and sixty-five thousand in cash. That's over two years of runway even if you had zero other income. Plus investments that, despite the downturn, are worth over five hundred thousand. You're not in any immediate danger.
RF: It doesn't feel that way.
DC: I know. But the numbers say you're okay. Not wealthy beyond your dreams, but okay. Even if the worst happened – you left the business with nothing, the investments stayed flat, Marcus kept working – you could sustain your lifestyle for years while you figured out next steps.
MF: That's actually reassuring to hear from someone objective.
DC: That's what I'm here for. Now, let's talk about what we should be doing given the uncertainty. First, protection. Your personal life insurance and critical illness cover – are those still in place?
RF: Yes. Still paying the premiums. The life cover is five hundred thousand, critical illness is five hundred thousand. For me anyway. Marcus has three hundred thousand of each.
DC: Good. Those are personal policies, not tied to the business, so they remain in force regardless of what happens at Grafton. And you're forty-eight now?
RF: Forty-nine in April.
DC: So still relatively young. If you did leave the business and wanted to get back into the job market – executive roles, NED positions, consulting – you'd have options.
RF: I've been thinking about that. What I'd actually do if I wasn't running Grafton. It's been my whole identity for so long.
DC: What conclusions have you reached?
RF: I don't know. Part of me wants to never work again – just stop, rest, recover. Another part thinks I'd go mad without something to do. Maybe some portfolio career – a few non-exec boards, some mentoring, that kind of thing.
DC: Either is financially viable, which is the important point. You have choices.
RF: That's a good way to look at it.
DC: Now, pensions. You were maximising contributions using carry-forward. Have you continued that?
RF: Yes. Another sixty thousand went in this year. Though I'm wondering if I should stop given everything that's happening.
DC: Why would you stop?
RF: Cash flow. If my income drops, I might need that money for living expenses rather than locking it away in a pension.
DC: That's a valid consideration. But let me push back slightly. You've just told me you have two hundred and sixty-five thousand in cash – over two years of expenses. You don't need to conserve cash that aggressively. And pension contributions at your tax rate are incredibly valuable. You're paying forty-five percent tax on income. Money that goes into a pension grows tax-free and you'll pay much less tax when you take it out. Plus it's protected from creditors and outside your estate for inheritance tax.
RF: So you think I should continue?
DC: I think you should contribute what you can comfortably afford. Maybe not the absolute maximum if it makes you anxious, but certainly don't stop entirely. Even twenty or thirty thousand would be valuable.
RF: Okay. That feels more manageable.
DC: And ISAs – are you still contributing?
RF: We both maxed them out again this year. Twenty thousand each.
DC: Good. Keep doing that. It's tax-free growth forever.
DC: What about the inherited shares Marcus holds – BP and Shell? Did you ever establish the base cost?
MF: I did actually. Dug through Dad's paperwork when we were sorting out his affairs. The probate value when he died was about twenty-eight thousand. They're worth about thirty-five thousand now, so there's a modest gain.
DC: That's useful to know. Have you thought any more about selling them?
MF: With Dad gone, it feels even harder. They were his investments. He believed in those companies. Selling them would feel like... I don't know, letting go of another piece of him.
DC: I understand. There's no financial urgency. The annual exemption means you could sell about ten thousand worth per year with minimal tax. You could do it gradually if you ever wanted to. But there's no pressure.
RF: We've talked about it. Maybe after things settle down.
DC: Okay. Now, let's discuss what happens if the business situation resolves positively. If a new buyer emerges and you do complete a sale – even at a reduced valuation – the inheritance tax planning we discussed becomes relevant again. Have you given that any more thought?
RF: Not really. It's felt too theoretical while everything else was up in the air.
DC: That's understandable. But let me remind you why it matters. If you received, say, eight million pounds from a sale after tax, and that sat in your estate, the inheritance tax on death – at forty percent above the thresholds – could be three million pounds or more going to HMRC instead of to Olivia and Ethan.
RF: It still seems like a nice problem to have.
DC: It is. But it's also a solvable problem if you plan in advance. Gifts, trusts, pension contributions, insurance – there are strategies. The key is implementing them before you have the money, not after.
RF: Can we revisit that when there's actually a sale on the table?
DC: Of course. Just don't leave it too late. These things take time to set up properly.
DC: A few more things to cover. The mortgage renewal – August 2027, you said. That's nine months away. Have you thought about what you'll do?
RF: Not in detail. We'll need to remortgage somewhere. I'm assuming rates will be around four to four and a half percent based on what we're seeing now.
DC: That's probably realistic. On a balance of two hundred and eighty thousand, with say seventeen years remaining on the term, you'd be looking at payments of around two thousand a month. Up from the current two thousand six hundred, but you're paying down a larger balance at the moment. Net effect might actually be similar.
RF: Oh. I hadn't realised that.
DC: The extra hundred thousand you paid off makes a big difference. You've reduced the capital, so even at a higher rate, the actual payment isn't dramatically worse.
RF: That's one less thing to worry about then.
DC: Exactly. And if your income situation changes, you could always extend the term to reduce monthly payments. You've got flexibility.
DC: Health – how are you both doing? You mentioned anxiety medication, Rebecca.
RF: Yes. Sertraline. Started in August when everything was falling apart. It's helped, actually. I'm sleeping better. Less of the constant dread.
DC: Good. Any impact on your protection policies?
RF: I had to declare it when I renewed the income protection. They didn't change the premium, but it's noted on my file.
DC: And physically?
RF: Blood pressure is slightly higher. The doctor's increased my medication. He says it's stress-related and should improve when life calms down. If life calms down.
MF: I'm keeping an eye on her. Making sure she actually eats lunch instead of working through it.
DC: That's important. Your health is the foundation of everything else. If you burn out completely, nothing else matters.
RF: I know. I'm trying.
DC: Marcus, how about you?
MF: I'm okay. Tired from all the driving to Shrewsbury and back. Sad about Dad. But fundamentally fine.
DC: Good. Let me just check – are there any other changes I should know about? New debts? Major purchases? Family issues?
RF: Olivia's boyfriend situation from last year – that resolved itself. They broke up. Probably for the best given she's off to Cambridge.
DC: Okay. Anything else?
RF: No, I think we've covered everything.
DC: Alright. Let me summarise where we are and what we're going to do. Financially, you're in a solid position despite the market downturn and the failed business sale. You've got significant liquid assets, low debt, good protection, and Marcus's income as a stable base. The uncertainty is around Rebecca's role at Grafton and what happens with the PE firm.
RF: That's a fair summary.
DC: Actions from my side: I'm going to update the cashflow model with three scenarios – you stay at Grafton and a sale completes in 2028, you leave Grafton voluntarily and pursue portfolio career, or you're pushed out and have to rely on personal assets plus Marcus's income. I want to show you that all three are viable, just different.
RF: That would be helpful.
DC: Actions for you: Continue engaging with your corporate lawyer to protect your position. Don't make any hasty decisions about leaving the business – you're more valuable inside than outside right now. Keep contributing to pensions and ISAs at a level that feels comfortable. And please – prioritise your health. Take time off if you can.
RF: I'll try.
DC: Marcus, keep supporting Rebecca. And let me know when you've sorted out the situation with your mother's housing – there might be financial planning implications we should consider.
MF: Will do.
DC: Fees – everything's continuing as before. The ongoing management fee is based on assets under management, which have dropped, so your fee has actually reduced slightly. I know that's cold comfort when your portfolio is down, but it does mean you're not paying the same fee for less money.
RF: I hadn't thought of it that way, but yes.
DC: One last thing. I know this year has been brutal. I know it feels like everything is going wrong at once. But you've made good decisions – selling the flat, paying down the mortgage, maintaining your protection, holding your nerve on investments. Those decisions will serve you well whatever happens next.
RF: Thank you, David. It helps to hear that.
MF: It really does. We came into this meeting feeling quite low. I feel a bit better now.
DC: That's what I'm here for. Let's catch up again before Christmas – maybe a shorter call just to check in. And obviously, call me anytime if something happens with the business situation. I want to know if there are developments.
RF: I will. Thanks, David.
MF: Yes, thank you.
RF: Before you go – can I ask something that's been nagging at me?
DC: Of course.
RF: The investments. The ones that are down. Should we be doing something different? Moving to safer funds? I keep reading about defensive portfolios and capital preservation strategies. Are we too exposed to equities?
DC: It's a really good question, and I'm glad you're asking rather than just acting. Let me explain why I don't think we should change strategy.
RF: Okay.
DC: When we set up your portfolio, we agreed on a medium-to-high risk approach for long-term money. That was based on your time horizon – you weren't going to need this money for ten to fifteen years – and your capacity for loss, which was high because your income covered all your expenses.
RF: That's still true. Mostly.
DC: Exactly. The fundamentals haven't changed. Yes, there's more uncertainty about your business income, but you've got cash reserves, Marcus is working, and you don't need to touch these investments. The question is: has your attitude to risk changed?
RF: [Pause] I'm definitely more anxious about it than I was. Seeing those numbers drop... it's visceral.
DC: That's completely normal. Everyone feels more cautious after a market fall. But here's the thing – if we moved to defensive assets now, we'd be locking in losses. You'd be selling your equity funds at a low point and buying bonds or cash that will give you lower returns over the long term. When markets recover – and they will – you'd miss the recovery.
MF: That's what I keep saying. You can't time the market.
DC: Marcus is right. The research is very clear on this. Investors who panic-sell during downturns and then wait for "the right moment" to get back in almost always underperform investors who just stay invested.
RF: But what if markets keep falling? What if this is like 2008 and we're only halfway down?
DC: Then they'll keep falling regardless of what you do. And eventually, they'll recover. In 2008, markets dropped over forty percent. They recovered fully within about five years. If you'd sold at the bottom, you'd have missed one of the biggest bull markets in history. If you'd held, you'd have ended up significantly ahead.
RF: I know that intellectually. It's just hard to hold when you're watching money disappear.
DC: Which is why we keep part of your wealth in cash and short-term assets. That's your safety net. The invested money is for long-term growth. Try not to think of them as the same thing.
RF: Okay. I'll try.
DC: And if it helps – don't look at the valuations. Quarterly at most. Maybe even less often. The more you watch it, the more anxious you'll feel, and the more tempted you'll be to do something counterproductive.
MF: I've hidden the Fidelity app on her phone. It's buried in a folder called "Do Not Open."
RF: [Laughs weakly] He really has.
DC: That's actually excellent advice. Out of sight, out of mind.
DC: Now, I wanted to circle back to the business situation. You mentioned the PE firm might try to dilute your shareholding. Can you explain what that would look like?
RF: So, there are provisions in the shareholders' agreement that allow them to issue new shares in certain circumstances. If they brought in a new investor, or if they structured a deal in a particular way, they could potentially reduce my percentage ownership without my consent.
DC: And your corporate lawyer is reviewing this?
RF: Yes. She thinks I have some protections, but they're not watertight. The agreement was drafted twelve years ago when I had less negotiating power. With hindsight, I should have pushed for stronger anti-dilution provisions.
DC: Hindsight is always perfect. What matters now is protecting what you have. Are there any scenarios where you could be forced to sell your shares at an undervalue?
RF: The drag-along clause is the main risk. If the PE firm finds a buyer and that buyer wants to acquire a hundred percent of the company, they can force minority shareholders – including me – to sell at the same price per share they're getting.
DC: And you'd have no veto?
RF: I'd have limited veto rights. I can object if the price is below a certain floor – which is linked to the original investment value plus a return hurdle – but if they're above that floor, I'm stuck.
DC: What's the floor?
RF: About fifteen million for the whole company. Which would value my stake at around six point seven million.
DC: That's still meaningful money. But it's obviously less than the twenty-five million valuation you were hoping for.
RF: Exactly. And after tax, I'd be looking at maybe four to five million rather than eight to ten million. It's a big difference.
DC: It is. But I want to reframe this slightly. Four to five million pounds, added to your existing assets, would still be transformative. You could retire immediately if you wanted. You could fund Olivia and Ethan through university and help them onto the property ladder. You could travel extensively, maintain your lifestyle, never worry about money again. It's not the outcome you were hoping for, but it's not a disaster.
RF: You're right. I've been so focused on what I might lose that I've forgotten what I'd still have.
DC: That's very human. We all anchor to our expectations. But from where you were three years ago – before we started working together – to where you'd be even in a pessimistic scenario, the trajectory is still enormously positive.
RF: That's a helpful perspective.
DC: And there's another angle to consider. If the PE firm does push you out or force a sale at a low valuation, and you believe they've breached your rights or acted in bad faith, you might have legal recourse. Claims for unfair prejudice, breach of fiduciary duty, that kind of thing. I'm not a lawyer, but it's worth discussing with your solicitor.
RF: She's mentioned it. Said to document everything – every conversation, every email, every decision they make that seems designed to disadvantage me.
DC: That's smart advice. Keep a paper trail. If it ever comes to litigation, you'll need evidence.
RF: It's exhausting though. Feeling like I have to watch my back in a company I built.
DC: I can only imagine. But you're doing the right things. You're protecting yourself legally and financially. You're not making rash decisions. You're getting professional advice. That's all you can do.
DC: One more thing on the business. If you did leave – voluntarily or otherwise – and you wanted to work again, what would you realistically be looking at?
RF: I've thought about this a lot. I'm a forty-eight-year-old woman with fourteen years' experience as a CEO of a mid-sized manufacturing company. That's a pretty specific niche.
DC: What roles would suit you?
RF: Non-executive directorships, probably. Companies looking for board members with manufacturing or sustainability expertise. Maybe private equity firms who want operating partners to advise on portfolio companies. Consulting to businesses going through what Grafton went through – the pivot to premium, the sustainability transition.
DC: And what might that pay?
RF: NEDs typically get twenty to forty thousand per board seat, depending on the size of company. Operating partner roles can be more – maybe a hundred to two hundred thousand plus carried interest. Consulting is harder to predict – probably fifty to a hundred thousand if I was selective about projects.
DC: So a portfolio of two or three NED roles plus some consulting could realistically generate a hundred to two hundred thousand a year?
RF: In theory, yes. Whether I could actually land those roles is another question. It's competitive, and I don't have a huge network outside manufacturing.
DC: But you have time to build that network now, while you're still in role. Attending industry events, accepting speaking invitations, connecting with headhunters. All of that positions you better if you do need to transition.
RF: I've been terrible at that. Too focused on the day job.
DC: Start now. Even an hour a week on networking and profile-building would help. And it doesn't have to be cynical – you can genuinely engage with the sustainability manufacturing community, share your expertise, contribute. The career benefits follow naturally.
RF: That's good advice. I'll try to do more of that.
DC: Okay. I think we've covered everything. Let me summarise the key actions one more time. From me: updated cashflow modelling with multiple scenarios, and I'll send that within two weeks. From you: continue working with your corporate lawyer, maintain pension and ISA contributions at a comfortable level, don't make any investment changes based on short-term market movements, prioritise health, and start building your external profile in case you need to transition careers.
RF: Got it.
DC: And Marcus – your action is to look after Rebecca and let me know how things progress with your mother's housing situation.
MF: Will do.
DC: Good. Let's schedule a check-in call for mid-December. Nothing formal, just a catch-up to see how things are developing.
RF: That sounds good.
DC: Take care of yourselves. This has been a tough year, but you're handling it well. Better times are ahead.
RF: I hope you're right.
MF: Thanks, David. Really appreciate it.
DC: Speak soon. Bye for now.
RF: Bye.
MF: Bye.
