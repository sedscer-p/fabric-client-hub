A: Before we get stuck in, tea or coffee?
J: Coffee would be great, thanks. Strong if possible — had a late one last night.
A: One of those?
J: Yeah. Couldn’t switch off. Brain doing that thing where it jumps between work stuff and money stuff at 2am.
A: You’re not alone there. Alright, let’s make this as relaxed as possible. There’s no right or wrong answers today. I’m just trying to understand you and what’s going on. Sound okay?
J: Yeah. That’s what I need, I think.
A: So, give me the quick snapshot — you, family, life at the moment.
J: Okay. I’m 45, live in Wimbledon with my wife Emma and our two kids. Sophie’s ten, Tom’s seven. Married thirteen years. Life is… good, but full on.
A: Full on how?
J: Work’s intense. Kids’ schedules are intense. Parents are getting older. And somewhere in the middle of that I’m supposed to be planning for the future, which I’ve mostly avoided until now.
A: What made now the moment?
J: Honestly? A mix of turning forty-five and a health scare. I had chest pains late last year. Turned out to be stress, not my heart, but it shook me.
A: I can imagine.
J: I suddenly thought, “If something actually happened to me… would everything be okay?” And I didn’t like how uncertain the answer was.
A: That’s a big realisation. When you think about the future now, what feels most important?
J: Security. For Emma and the kids. I want to know that if I wasn’t here — or couldn’t work — they’d be alright. Not scrambling. Not panicking.
A: That’s a very strong starting point. Let’s talk about how things are set up today. Starting with work — what do you do?
J: I’m Commercial Director at a SaaS company. Been there six years.
A: And income-wise?
J: Base salary £130k. Bonus on top — target is £40k but it’s not guaranteed. Last year I got most of it. This year… who knows.
A: Does that variability affect how you feel?
J: Definitely. Especially with the industry the way it is. Layoffs, restructures — you hear about it constantly.
A: Do you feel secure in your role?
J: Secure-ish. I’m senior enough to have some protection, but not immune. No one is.
A: And Emma’s work?
J: She’s freelance now. Marketing consultant. Earns around £30k most years. It works for the kids, but it’s not predictable.
A: So household income has a fair bit of variability.
J: Yeah. Which is why I worry about cash buffers and all that.
A: Let’s talk about that. If something unexpected happened — job loss, illness — how long could you realistically cover expenses?
J: Probably… three months comfortably? Six if we really tightened belts.
A: How does that feel?
J: Not great. It sounds worse when I say it out loud.
A: It’s not unusual, but it’s important. Do you consciously maintain an emergency fund?
J: Sort of. We have savings — about £45k in cash — but it’s not ring-fenced. It’s mentally earmarked for everything and nothing.
A: Renovations, school, holidays?
J: Exactly. So it doesn’t feel like a safety net, more like a pot we dip into.
A: Okay. Let’s talk assets more broadly. You mentioned your home.
J: Yeah. Three-bed semi. Mortgage outstanding around £420k.
A: Rate?
J: Fixed at 1.9% until next summer. Which I’m trying very hard not to think about.
A: But you are thinking about it.
J: Constantly. I’m assuming it’ll jump to five, maybe six percent. That’s a big difference monthly.
A: Have you run the numbers?
J: Roughly. Enough to make me wince.
A: Any other property?
J: No.
A: Pensions?
J: Messy. Current workplace pension with Aviva — about £310k. Then two older ones from previous jobs. Combined maybe £150k. I’ve never consolidated them.
A: Do you know how they’re invested?
J: Broadly. Default funds, I think. Which is another thing that worries me — it feels very passive.
A: And Emma’s pension?
J: That’s even more vague. She has a small pension from when she worked full-time years ago — maybe £40k? Since going freelance she hasn’t really contributed regularly.
A: How do you feel about that?
J: Guilty. Like I should have pushed it more. But also aware that cashflow’s tighter with her working part-time.
A: Any other investments?
J: ISAs — stocks and shares. About £90k combined. Mostly funds.
A: And you mentioned crypto last time.
J: Yeah… lockdown mistake. Put in £15k. Worth about £8k now.
A: How do you feel about it emotionally?
J: Stupid, but stubborn. It’s like admitting failure if I sell.
A: Totally normal response.
J: I’ve stopped adding to it though. That’s my compromise.
A: Any other behaviours around money you think are relevant?
J: Gambling, a bit. Football betting. Usually small stakes, but during the World Cup it got carried away. I noticed it because it felt… compulsive.
A: How is it now?
J: Under control. But I’m aware it’s a stress response for me.
A: That self-awareness is important.
J: Supporting AFC Wimbledon helps — keeps football joyful rather than just transactional.
A: Love that. Let’s talk about protection. If you were unable to work due to illness, what happens?
J: Through work I have income protection and death in service. I think income protection pays 75% after six months? But I’m not 100% sure.
A: And death in service?
J: Four times salary, I believe.
A: Do you have any personal policies outside of work?
J: No. And that worries me. If I left my job, I think all of that disappears.
A: That’s a valid concern. What about life insurance specifically?
J: None outside work. We talked about it years ago when we got the mortgage, but never followed through.
A: If you died tomorrow, do you know if Emma could stay in the house?
J: With death in service, probably. Without it… I don’t know. That’s uncomfortable to admit.
A: That’s exactly why we talk about it here. What about wills?
J: We have wills. Done when Tom was born.
A: Do you know what they say?
J: Broadly. Everything to each other, kids as beneficiaries, guardians named.
A: Have they been reviewed since?
J: No. And we don’t have Lasting Powers of Attorney, which I know we should.
A: What’s stopped you?
J: Morbid avoidance. Same reason people don’t update wills.
A: Completely human. How about the kids — any savings for them?
J: Yes. Junior ISAs. About £12k each. We put in a bit each month, but it’s not maxed.
A: What’s the intention there?
J: Help with uni or a house deposit. Though part of me worries about giving an 18-year-old a lump sum.
A: That’s a very common worry.
J: Sophie would probably spend it on something ridiculous.
A: Let’s touch briefly on fees, so you know how this usually works. For most clients, there’s an initial planning fee — usually a few thousand pounds — to build a full plan. Then, if you want ongoing advice, that’s typically a percentage of assets or a fixed annual fee. We can tailor that.
J: Okay. That feels fair. I just didn’t want any surprises.
A: Completely understandable. Transparency is important.
J: Can I be honest about something?
A: Always.
J: I worry that I’ve left this too late. That I should have done all this in my thirties when I had more energy and fewer responsibilities.
A: That feeling comes up a lot. But you’ve actually built a solid base. This isn’t about catching up — it’s about organising and protecting what you already have.
J: That’s reassuring.
A: How are you feeling right now?
J: A bit exposed. But also lighter. Like I’ve finally opened a cupboard that’s been jammed shut for years.
A: That’s a good description of a first meeting.
J: I’m glad I came. Even talking about health and worst-case scenarios — it’s uncomfortable, but necessary.
A: And we go at your pace. Nothing gets forced.
J: Thank you. That means a lot.
A: Let’s leave it there for today. Next time we can start turning this into something more structured — protection, planning, priorities.
J: Sounds good. And… thanks for making it feel human, not clinical.
A: That’s the goal.
