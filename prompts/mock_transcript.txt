[2:00 PM – Meeting Commences]

DC: Good afternoon, Rebecca. Lovely to finally meet you in person. Please, do come in. Can I get you something to drink? Tea, coffee, water?

RF: Afternoon, David. Coffee would be lovely, thank you. White, one sugar.

DC: Coming right up. Please, take a seat and make yourself comfortable.

[Brief pause – 2 minutes]

DC: Here we go. So, how was your journey into Birmingham today?

RF: Not too bad, actually. I'm based in Solihull, so it's only about twenty minutes on the train. Quicker than driving in with the traffic.

DC: Oh yes, Solihull's lovely. We've got quite a few clients from that area. The traffic into the city centre can be a nightmare, especially this time of day. Right, well, thank you so much for coming in. Before we get started properly, I'd like to set out what we'll cover today and how the meeting will work. Does that sound okay?

RF: Yes, absolutely. I appreciate you taking the time.

DC: Not at all. So, today is what we call a discovery meeting. It's really about me getting to know you – your circumstances, your family, your finances, and most importantly, what you want to achieve. I won't be making any recommendations today or trying to sell you anything. This is purely about gathering information and understanding your situation. After today, I'll go away and do a thorough analysis, and then we'll have a second meeting where I'll present tailored recommendations. Does that make sense?

RF: Yes, that's exactly what I was hoping for. I don't want to be rushed into anything.

DC: Absolutely. We never rush. Good financial planning takes time. Now, I should also mention that this meeting is being recorded. It's a compliance requirement and helps me ensure I've captured everything accurately. The recording is stored securely on encrypted servers and only accessed by me and our compliance team if needed. Are you comfortable with that?

RF: That's fine. I expected as much.

DC: Great. And just to confirm, you received the client agreement and privacy policy documents I sent over?

RF: I did, yes. Had a read through them over the weekend.

DC: Excellent. Any questions or concerns about those?

RF: No, they seemed fairly standard.

DC: Good. Right, so let's start at the beginning. Tell me about yourself, Rebecca – your background, your family situation, and what's brought you here today.

RF: Okay, well, I'm forty-six – forty-seven in April. I've been married to my husband Marcus for eighteen years. He's forty-nine. We've got two children – Olivia who's sixteen, doing her GCSEs next summer, and Ethan who's thirteen, just started Year 9.

DC: And you're all based in Solihull?

RF: Yes, we've been there about twelve years now. Moved from Warwick when I took over as MD at the company.

DC: And the company is Grafton Writing Instruments?

RF: That's right. We manufacture pencils, primarily. Standard graphite pencils, coloured pencils, mechanical pencils, that sort of thing. We've got a factory in Redditch and a smaller facility in Wales for our premium range.

DC: That's fascinating. How did you come to be MD?

RF: It's a bit of an unusual story, actually. The company was founded in the 1950s by the Grafton family. I joined straight from university as a graduate trainee – I did Business Management at Warwick – and worked my way up. When the last family member decided to retire about twelve years ago, they didn't have any children interested in taking over, so they offered me the opportunity to buy them out with the backing of a private equity firm.

DC: So you're an owner-manager?

RF: Yes. I own forty-five percent of the company. The PE firm owns forty percent, and the remaining fifteen percent is held by other senior managers who've been given equity stakes over the years.

DC: That's a significant achievement. How's the business performing?

RF: Really well, actually. We've had to reinvent ourselves quite a bit – the cheap imports from China nearly killed us in the early 2010s. But we pivoted to focus on premium, sustainable products. British-made, FSC-certified wood, that kind of thing. Schools love it because of the environmental angle, and there's a surprising market for premium stationery among adults too. Turnover last year was about eighteen million, profit before tax around one point eight million.

DC: Impressive. And how many employees?

RF: About ninety across both sites, plus a small head office team.

DC: So what's prompted you to come and see us now? What's on your mind financially?

RF: [Sighs] Honestly? I've been so focused on building the business for the last twelve years that I've neglected my personal finances. Marcus keeps nagging me about it. We've accumulated quite a bit of money, but it's just sitting in various accounts not really doing anything. I know we're not being tax-efficient, I know we're not making the most of our pensions, and I've got this nagging worry that despite earning good money, we might not actually be on track for the retirement we want.

DC: That's a very common story, particularly among business owners. You're so busy running the company that your own finances get pushed down the priority list.

RF: Exactly. And I turned forty-six this year, which felt like a bit of a wake-up call. I'd like to have the option to step back from the business by sixty, maybe earlier if the PE firm wants an exit before then. That's potentially fourteen years away, which sounds like a long time but really isn't.

DC: It goes by quickly. Fourteen years ago feels like yesterday.

RF: It really does.

DC: Well, you've come to the right place. Let's start building up a comprehensive picture of where you are today. I've got some information from the online form you completed, but I'd like to go through everything in detail. Let's start with income. Can you walk me through your total earnings?

RF: Sure. My basic salary from the company is one hundred and seventy thousand. On top of that, I receive dividends from my shareholding. Last year that was about seventy-five thousand. So total income of around two hundred and forty-five thousand.

DC: And is that fairly consistent year on year, or does it fluctuate?

RF: The salary is fixed – it's reviewed annually but hasn't changed much in the last few years. The dividends vary depending on profits and what the PE firm agrees to distribute. Could be anywhere from sixty to ninety thousand in a good year.

DC: Understood. And Marcus – does he work?

RF: Yes, he's a consultant for an engineering firm. He works four days a week – took a step back a few years ago when the kids were going through a tricky patch at school. He earns about sixty-five thousand.

DC: So combined household income of around three hundred and ten thousand?

RF: That's about right, yes.

DC: Lovely. Now let's talk about your regular outgoings. Do you have a good sense of what you spend each month?

RF: Roughly, yes. The mortgage is our biggest expense – that's two thousand six hundred a month. We bought the house for one point one million and still owe about four hundred thousand.

DC: What's the interest rate on that?

RF: We fixed at three point two percent about eighteen months ago. Comes off the fixed rate in about three and a half years.

DC: Okay, we'll make a note of that. What else?

RF: School fees. Both children are at Solihull School – Olivia's in sixth form, Ethan's in Year 9. That's about twenty-two thousand each per year, so roughly three thousand seven hundred a month combined.

DC: And how long will that continue?

RF: Olivia finishes in two years if she doesn't stay for A-levels... actually, she will stay for A-levels, so three years really. Then hopefully university. Ethan's got another five years of school.

DC: So school fees for another five years at least, potentially longer. That's useful to know. What else?

RF: [Pause] Let me think. Cars – I've got a company car, a BMW X5, so that's covered by the business. Marcus has a personal car, an Audi A4, which we own outright. Running costs on that are maybe four hundred a month including insurance, fuel, maintenance.

DC: Any other vehicles?

RF: No, that's it.

DC: Utilities, council tax, insurance?

RF: Council tax is about four hundred a month – it's a big house, Band H. Utilities maybe two hundred and fifty. Home insurance, life insurance, that sort of thing, probably another three hundred.

DC: Food shopping?

RF: We probably spend too much. [Laughs] Waitrose deliveries every week, eating out quite a bit. Maybe eight hundred a month all in on food and dining.

DC: And other regular commitments?

RF: Gym memberships for me and Marcus – that's about a hundred and fifty combined. Cleaner comes twice a week, that's about five hundred a month. Gardener, another two hundred. Then there's subscriptions, phones, broadband, Olivia's driving lessons at the moment... probably another four hundred for all that.

DC: Any other properties?

RF: Yes, we've got a flat in London. Bought it about seven years ago as a bolt-hole for when I have meetings down there. It's in Marylebone, one bedroom. Paid four hundred and fifty thousand for it, no mortgage. We rent it out on Airbnb when we're not using it.

DC: How much does that generate?

RF: It varies. Maybe fifteen to twenty thousand a year gross, but after service charges, management fees, and the various costs, we probably net about ten thousand.

DC: Any mortgage on that?

RF: No, we bought it outright.

DC: So that's a nice asset. And holidays, discretionary spending?

RF: We like to travel. At least two big holidays a year – we did South Africa last summer and skiing in Verbier in February. Plus usually a week somewhere in the Med during the October half-term. I'd estimate we spend about thirty to thirty-five thousand a year on holidays.

DC: Anything else significant? Home improvements, hobbies?

RF: Marcus plays golf, which isn't cheap. Membership, equipment, society trips... probably five thousand a year. I ride horses – I've got a horse stabled locally. That's about eight hundred a month all in. We're also talking about doing a major renovation on the house – extending the kitchen and adding a garden room. That could be a hundred and fifty thousand or more, but we haven't committed to anything yet.

DC: When might that happen?

RF: Possibly next year, possibly the year after. We need to decide.

DC: Okay. So if I'm doing rough maths here – your committed monthly outgoings are probably around eleven to twelve thousand, plus discretionary spending on top. Would that feel about right?

RF: Yes, probably closer to thirteen or fourteen thousand when you add everything up.

DC: Which still leaves you with a healthy surplus given your combined income of over three hundred thousand.

RF: Yes, we do save. Though probably not as cleverly as we should.

DC: Let's talk about that. Walk me through your assets – savings, investments, pensions, everything.

RF: Okay. So, cash savings first. We've got about two hundred and thirty thousand sitting in various savings accounts. Most of it's in easy access accounts at NatWest, earning next to nothing. There's a notice account with about sixty thousand at ninety days' notice. And I've got about thirty thousand in Premium Bonds.

DC: Any fixed-term bonds or other cash products?

RF: No, it's all accessible. Which is silly, really, because we don't need it to be.

DC: And what interest are you earning on the easy access accounts?

RF: [Pause] Honestly, I'm not sure. Whatever the standard rate is. It's embarrassingly low, I know.

DC: It's probably around one to two percent, which means you're losing money in real terms after inflation. And at your income level, you won't have a Personal Savings Allowance, so all the interest is taxable at forty-five percent for you and forty percent for Marcus.

RF: [Sighs] Yes, I know. That's partly why I'm here. Every year I get a tax bill for the interest and I think, this is ridiculous.

DC: It's very common, and it's something we can definitely address. What about ISAs?

RF: I've been pretty good about maxing out my ISA each year – most years, anyway. I've got about one hundred and twenty thousand in ISAs. It's split between cash ISAs and a Stocks and Shares ISA.

DC: Who's the provider?

RF: The Stocks and Shares ISA is with Fidelity. The cash ISAs are with various places – whoever had the best rate at the time.

DC: Do you know what the Stocks and Shares ISA is invested in?

RF: I set it up years ago and picked some funds... I couldn't tell you what they are off the top of my head. Something global, I think.

DC: That's fine, we can get the details. And Marcus – does he have ISAs?

RF: Yes, but not as much as me. Maybe sixty thousand? He's not been as consistent with it.

DC: Any other investments outside of ISAs?

RF: Yes. I've got a General Investment Account with about ninety thousand in it. That's with Fidelity as well, invested in similar funds to the ISA. And Marcus has some shares he inherited from his father about ten years ago – BP and Shell mostly. They're worth about forty thousand now.

DC: Those inherited shares – do you know what the base cost was for Capital Gains Tax purposes?

RF: I have no idea. His father's estate was handled by a solicitor and we've never really looked at it.

DC: It would be worth finding out. There could be significant gains or losses embedded in those shares. Any other investments?

RF: No, I don't think so.

DC: Okay. So liquid savings and investments of roughly... let's see... two hundred and thirty thousand in cash, one hundred and eighty thousand in ISAs between you, ninety thousand in the GIA, forty thousand in inherited shares, thirty thousand in Premium Bonds. That's about five hundred and seventy thousand in total. Does that sound right?

RF: Yes, I think so.

DC: Good. Now let's talk about pensions. This is often where we find the biggest opportunities.

RF: Okay. I've got a pension from my early career. When I first joined Grafton as a graduate, there was a defined benefit scheme. I was in it for about six years before they closed it and switched to defined contribution.

DC: A defined benefit scheme – that's valuable. Do you know what the projected annual pension is?

RF: I've got a statement somewhere... I think it said about twelve thousand a year at sixty-five, increasing with inflation.

DC: That's worth a significant amount as a capital value. Probably two hundred and fifty to three hundred thousand in today's terms. Has anyone ever approached you about transferring it?

RF: I've had letters, yes. I've always ignored them.

DC: Good. In most cases, keeping a defined benefit pension is the right thing to do. We'd need to analyse it properly, but generally the guarantees are very valuable.

RF: That's what I thought.

DC: And the defined contribution pension that replaced it?

RF: That's got about one hundred and thirty thousand in it. I've been contributing eight percent with the company putting in four percent for as long as I can remember.

DC: Who's the provider?

RF: Scottish Widows.

DC: And what's it invested in?

RF: [Pause] The default fund, probably? I've never changed it.

DC: Okay. Any other pensions?

RF: No, just those two.

DC: And Marcus?

RF: He's got a pension through his employer. He's been there about fifteen years. I think it's worth around one hundred and eighty thousand now. He's in their scheme where they match contributions up to six percent.

DC: So he's putting in six percent and they're matching it?

RF: I think so, yes.

DC: Now, here's something important. You're earning around two hundred and forty-five thousand, and pension contributions are one of the most tax-efficient ways to save at your income level. The annual allowance is sixty thousand, and based on what you've told me, you're using only a fraction of that.

RF: I know. My accountant has mentioned it several times. I just never got around to sorting it out.

DC: There might also be unused annual allowance from previous years that you can carry forward. We can look into that. It could be a significant opportunity.

RF: That would be great.

DC: Right. Now, let's talk about the big asset – the business. You mentioned you own forty-five percent?

RF: Yes. I bought out the original owners twelve years ago. The PE firm came in at the same time. The deal valued the whole business at about eight million then.

DC: And what's it worth now, do you think?

RF: [Pause] We've had a couple of informal approaches from trade buyers. Based on those conversations and our current profits, the advisers think the whole business could be worth twenty to twenty-five million now. So my forty-five percent would be nine to eleven million, roughly.

DC: That's a substantial asset.

RF: It is. But it's all theoretical until someone actually writes a cheque. And there's the PE firm to consider – they'll want their exit at some point, probably in the next three to five years.

DC: How would an exit typically work?

RF: There are a few options. Trade sale to a larger stationery or office supplies company. Secondary buyout by another PE firm. Or possibly a management buyout, though I'm not sure the management team could raise the funds.

DC: And what would you want to happen?

RF: Honestly? I'd like to find a buyer who'd keep the company going, keep the jobs in Redditch. But I'd also like to get a fair price and be able to step back. I'm tired, David. Twelve years as MD, it takes it out of you.

DC: I can imagine. Have you done any formal succession planning or exit planning?

RF: We've had high-level conversations with the PE firm's advisers, but nothing detailed. It's on the list.

DC: It's something we should definitely factor into your planning. An exit could be transformative for your personal finances, but it also needs careful tax planning. There are things like Business Asset Disposal Relief, the Investors' Relief, share restructuring... it can get complicated.

RF: That's partly why I'm here. I want to make sure I'm in the best position when the time comes.

DC: Good. Any other significant assets we haven't covered?

RF: Um... jewellery, I suppose. I've got some pieces from my mother that are probably worth twenty to thirty thousand. Nothing else significant.

DC: And liabilities beyond the mortgage?

RF: No. We pay off credit cards in full. No loans.

DC: That's a healthy position. Now, let's talk about protection. Do you have life insurance?

RF: Yes. There's a death-in-service benefit through the company – four times salary, so about six hundred and eighty thousand. And Marcus and I both have personal policies we took out when we bought the house. Two hundred thousand each, I think.

DC: How long do those personal policies have left to run?

RF: I'm not sure. We took them out when we bought the house twelve years ago, so... maybe thirteen years left? They were twenty-five year terms.

DC: And the death-in-service benefit – do you know if it's written in trust?

RF: I have no idea. What does that mean?

DC: If it's not in trust, the payout could form part of your estate when you die, which might create inheritance tax issues and delays in your family receiving the money. It's something we should check.

RF: Okay.

DC: Any critical illness cover?

RF: No. We looked at it when we took out the life insurance, but it seemed expensive.

DC: And income protection?

RF: No.

DC: That's worth discussing. As the MD and major shareholder, what would happen to your income if you were unable to work due to illness for, say, a year?

RF: [Pause] The business would keep running – I've got a good operations director and finance director. But my salary... I suppose the board would have to decide. I hadn't really thought about it.

DC: It's something we should consider. Your earned income is your biggest asset at this stage. A serious illness could have significant financial consequences.

RF: You're right. It's not something I've thought about.

DC: Let's talk about wills and estate planning. Do you and Marcus have wills?

RF: Yes, we made them about ten years ago, when the children were younger.

DC: Have they been updated since?

RF: No. We keep meaning to, but...

DC: I hear that a lot. They really should be reviewed. Your circumstances have changed significantly – the business is worth much more now, you've got the London flat, your overall wealth has increased substantially. There could be inheritance tax implications.

RF: Inheritance tax – that's the forty percent charge on estates, isn't it?

DC: That's right. The nil-rate band is three hundred and twenty-five thousand per person, with an additional residence nil-rate band of one hundred and seventy-five thousand if you're leaving your home to direct descendants. But with your level of assets, there could be a meaningful liability.

RF: Even with the business?

DC: The business might qualify for Business Relief, which could mean it passes free of inheritance tax. But it depends on the nature of the business and whether certain conditions are met. It's not automatic. We'd need to look at it carefully.

RF: This is getting complicated.

DC: It can be. That's why it's important to have proper advice. Do you have Lasting Powers of Attorney?

RF: What are those?

DC: They're legal documents that allow someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you lose mental capacity. There are two types – one for financial decisions and one for health and welfare. They're really important, especially for business owners.

RF: We don't have those. Should we?

DC: I'd strongly recommend it. Without them, if something happened to you, Marcus would have to go through the Court of Protection to manage your affairs, which can take months and cost thousands. For a business owner, that could be very problematic.

RF: Right. We should look into that.

DC: I can recommend solicitors who specialise in this if that would help.

RF: Yes, please.

DC: Now, let's talk about what you actually want to achieve. You mentioned wanting to step back from the business by sixty. What does retirement look like to you?

RF: [Pause] I think... I'd like to have freedom. Freedom to travel, to spend time with Marcus, to see more of the children as they grow up and have families of their own. I might do some consulting or non-executive director work to keep my brain active, but I don't want to be running a business day-to-day.

DC: And in terms of lifestyle, how do you see your spending in retirement?

RF: I don't think we'd scale back much, honestly. We'd probably travel more, not less. The mortgage would be paid off by then, the school fees would be done, but we'd still want to maintain the properties, support the children if they need it. I'd probably keep riding. Marcus would keep playing golf.

DC: So similar to now but without the mortgage and school fees?

RF: Yes. Maybe a bit less because we'd be less busy and stressed so less need for expensive decompression holidays. [Laughs]

DC: If I suggested a figure of around one hundred thousand a year in retirement, would that feel about right?

RF: Maybe slightly more. Let's say one hundred to one hundred and twenty thousand.

DC: Okay. And before retirement, what are your main financial goals?

RF: The children's education is the priority. Getting them through school and university without them having to worry about money. Olivia's talking about studying medicine, which is a long course. Ethan doesn't know what he wants to do yet.

DC: Would you pay their full university costs?

RF: Yes, I think so. Tuition fees and living expenses. I don't want them graduating with massive debt.

DC: Current tuition fees are about nine thousand a year. Living costs in London or another expensive city could easily be fifteen thousand a year. Medicine is typically five to six years. So for Olivia alone, you could be looking at around one hundred and forty thousand over the course.

RF: [Exhales] When you put it like that...

DC: It adds up. Ethan could be similar or less depending on what he chooses. Have you thought about helping them onto the property ladder?

RF: Yes. The way house prices are going, they'll need help. We'd like to give them each a deposit when the time comes.

DC: Do you have a figure in mind?

RF: I don't know. A hundred thousand each? Is that realistic?

DC: It's certainly generous. In some parts of the country, it would be a substantial deposit. In London or the South East, it might cover less. But it's a good starting point for planning.

RF: Okay.

DC: Any other major goals or uses of money you're planning?

RF: The house renovation, potentially. Although if we're being sensible, maybe we should wait until the children have left home. Otherwise... no, I don't think so.

DC: What about supporting your parents or Marcus's parents?

RF: My parents are both gone, sadly. Mum passed three years ago, Dad a few years before that. Marcus's parents are in their late seventies. His father was a civil servant with a good pension, and his mother was a teacher, so they're comfortable. But they might need care eventually.

DC: Care costs can be significant. A good care home in the Midlands can be fifty to seventy thousand a year. It's worth being aware of.

RF: We've talked about it. We'd help them if needed.

DC: Good to know. Now, let me ask you about your attitude to investment risk. How would you describe yourself as an investor?

RF: Cautious but not stupid. I understand that money in cash loses value over time. I understand that you need to take some risk to get returns. But I've built a business, so I've got plenty of risk there. I don't want to gamble with our personal savings.

DC: That's a very sensible perspective. If you invested a hundred thousand pounds and saw it drop to seventy-five thousand in a market crash, how would you react?

RF: [Pause] I'd be worried, obviously. But I wouldn't panic. I remember 2008, I remember Covid. Markets recover. As long as we didn't need the money immediately...

DC: Have you experienced significant investment losses before?

RF: During Covid, my Fidelity ISA dropped quite a lot. Maybe twenty percent? I didn't sell, I just waited. It came back.

DC: That's a good sign. Many investors panic-sell at exactly the wrong time. How long are you comfortable leaving money invested without needing to access it?

RF: For retirement savings, at least fourteen years. For other money, it depends. Some we might need in the next few years for the renovation or school fees.

DC: That's helpful. We'd need to match different pots of money to different time horizons and risk levels. And between generating growth and generating income, what's more important to you right now?

RF: Growth. We've got more income than we need. We don't need investments to pay us dividends.

DC: Are there any types of investments you'd want to avoid? Some people have ethical preferences.

RF: Yes, actually. I've become quite focused on sustainability through the business. I'd prefer not to invest in fossil fuels, tobacco, gambling, weapons – that sort of thing. Is that possible?

DC: Absolutely. There's a wide range of sustainable and ESG-focused investment options available now. It's one of the fastest-growing areas of the market.

RF: Good. That would be important to us.

DC: Based on everything you've told me, I'd probably assess you as a medium-risk investor, perhaps medium-high for money with longer time horizons. But we'd do a formal risk assessment before making any recommendations.

RF: That sounds about right.

DC: Good. Now, a few more questions to make sure I understand your situation fully. Do you have any health issues I should be aware of? This might affect protection recommendations.

RF: I'm generally healthy. I had a minor operation two years ago – gallbladder removal – but no ongoing issues. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but controlled with medication. Marcus is healthy as far as I know.

DC: And is there any family history of serious illness?

RF: My father had a heart attack in his sixties but lived until seventy-eight. My mother had dementia in her final years. Marcus's family seem to live forever.

DC: That's all useful context. And thinking about your capacity for loss – if we invested money for the long term and it fell in value, what would be the consequences for you? Would you need to access it? Would it affect your lifestyle?

RF: I don't think so. We've got the income from the business to cover our lifestyle. If our investments fell, it would be disappointing, but it wouldn't mean we couldn't pay the mortgage or school fees.

DC: That's an important point. It suggests you have reasonable capacity for loss on long-term investments. Your income is secure and your essential expenses are covered. What about if you lost your income – if the business failed or you had to leave?

RF: We'd have to adjust. Sell one of the properties, cut back on discretionary spending. It would be a shock, but we'd manage. We wouldn't be destitute.

DC: And you mentioned five hundred and seventy thousand in liquid assets. How much of that would you consider your emergency fund – money that must remain completely safe and accessible?

RF: Good question. [Pause] I suppose... a year's expenses as an absolute minimum? So probably a hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand that I wouldn't want to take any risk with.

DC: That's sensible. And the rest you'd be more comfortable investing for growth?

RF: Yes, I think so. Subject to what you recommend.

DC: Understood. Now, what about the London flat? What are your plans for that?

RF: Long term, I'm not sure. We use it less than we used to – a lot of meetings are virtual now. We've talked about selling it and taking the equity out, but I'm nervous about the Capital Gains Tax implications.

DC: There could be significant CGT on a sale. The gain is roughly the selling price minus what you paid, minus costs, and you'd pay twenty-four percent on that gain as a higher-rate taxpayer for residential property. With a property you paid four hundred and fifty thousand for, now worth maybe six hundred to six hundred and fifty thousand...

RF: So fifty to sixty thousand in tax?

DC: Potentially, yes. Although there are planning strategies around timing and use of annual exemptions. It's something we could look at if selling is on the cards.

RF: Hmm. Worth thinking about.

DC: Right. Let me summarise where I think we are. You and Marcus are in your mid to late forties, combined income around three hundred and ten thousand, monthly outgoings of around thirteen to fourteen thousand. You own your family home with about seven hundred thousand equity, plus the London flat worth around six hundred thousand with no mortgage. You have liquid savings and investments of around five hundred and seventy thousand, pensions worth maybe three hundred and fifty thousand between you, plus your defined benefit entitlement. And you have a business stake worth potentially nine to eleven million. You'd like to be able to retire or step back at sixty, maintain a lifestyle costing one hundred to one hundred and twenty thousand a year, fund your children's education and help them onto the property ladder. You're concerned about tax efficiency and want to be in the best position for a business exit.

RF: Yes, that's a good summary.

DC: And the areas I've identified to look at include pension planning – there's significant unused capacity there – tax efficiency on your savings and investments, protection gaps around critical illness and income protection, estate planning including wills and LPAs, and business exit planning including the interaction with your personal finances.

RF: That all makes sense.

DC: Good. Let me explain how we work. We charge fees rather than commission. For an initial financial plan of this scope – full analysis, comprehensive written recommendations, cashflow modelling – our fee would be four thousand five hundred pounds plus VAT. That covers all the work involved in analysing your situation, researching solutions, producing the plan, and presenting it to you.

RF: Okay.

DC: If you choose to implement recommendations through us, there would be implementation fees depending on what's involved. For ongoing advice and investment management, we charge an annual fee of nought point eight five percent of assets under management, which covers regular reviews, portfolio management, and access to me and the team throughout the year.

RF: And what if I just want the plan and then implement it myself?

DC: That's absolutely fine. The plan is yours to do with as you wish. Many clients find value in ongoing support, but it's not required.

RF: Fair enough. What happens next?

DC: If you're happy to proceed, I'll send you an engagement letter to sign. I'll also send a checklist of documents I need – recent pension statements, investment valuations, mortgage statements, tax returns for the last couple of years, and so on. I'll need to do identity verification for compliance purposes. Once I have everything, the analysis typically takes three to four weeks. Then we'll meet again to go through my recommendations. That meeting usually takes about two hours.

RF: Can Marcus come to the follow-up meeting?

DC: I'd strongly encourage it. Financial planning works best when both partners understand and are engaged with the plan. Especially estate planning – Marcus needs to know what would happen if something happened to you, and vice versa.

RF: Makes sense. I'll make sure he's there.

DC: Excellent. Any other questions?

RF: Yes, one thing that's been nagging at me. The business exit – if that happens in the next few years and I suddenly have eight or nine million pounds landing in my lap, does everything change? Does the plan we make now become irrelevant?

DC: It's a great question. The plan we create now will absolutely factor in the potential business exit. We'll model scenarios with and without an exit, at different valuations, at different timings. The fundamentals – pension planning, tax efficiency, protection, estate planning – are relevant regardless. And actually, getting these things sorted before an exit is really important. If you optimise your affairs now, you'll be in a much better position when the big event happens.

RF: That makes sense. I suppose I was worried about paying for advice and then everything changing.

DC: The advice needs to be adaptable. Life changes, circumstances change, tax rules change. That's why ongoing relationships often work well – we can adapt the plan as things evolve. But even if you just want the one-off plan, it will be designed to be robust to different scenarios.

RF: Good. I feel reassured.

DC: Any other questions?

RF: No, I think we've covered everything. This has been really helpful, David. I feel like a weight has been lifted just talking through everything.

DC: That's often how people feel after the first meeting. You've been carrying all this mental load, and now you've got someone to share it with. We'll put together a proper plan and give you clarity about where you are and where you're going.

RF: That's exactly what I need.

DC: Right, let me walk you out. I'll have the engagement letter and document checklist to you by end of day tomorrow.

RF: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time.

DC: My pleasure. Safe journey back to Solihull.
