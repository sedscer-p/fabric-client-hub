- The summary can be up to 250 words. Choose an appropriate length up to 250 words based on the length of the meeting.
- The Meeting Summary should be structured so it is easy to read and reference. Include two distinct parts: 'Summary' and 'Key Discussion Points'.
- Ensure the summary is formatted so it could easily be displayed in a UI without any manipulation.
- Use line breaks to enhance readability.
3. Identify any actions that were assigned to either the financial adviser or the client. Generate these actions in a sentence that can be sent to the financial adviser or client after the meeting.
